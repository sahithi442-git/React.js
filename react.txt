--->how to create Reacttwo ways
1)CDN ways
2)node ways(developers use node)

a) npm -used to install ,updatr, delete package in js.
        >packages will be installed globally.

     npm install -g create-react-application
     craete-react-app app-name

 b) npx- >used to execute packages without installing.    
       > no need to install packages globally.
         npx-craet-react- app app-name

         **By using Yarn,vite we can installlatest version of react
         npm create-vite@latest = install altest version of react


         component are 2 ypes classbased and function based
class component: it is  statefull component.
                 constructor is used to data,
                 it uses extended keyword


         import Recat from 'react'
         class demo extends React.component {
                render() {
                        return <h1> iam class based component</h1>
                }
         }
         export default demo;

functionbased component-it is javascript pure function.it doesnot have any react life cycle.
                        it doesnot uses render method.it is stateless.
                        after react 16.8 FBC become ststefuull component because of hooks,
                        no need of using constructor and extend keyword

                        import React from 'react'
                        functiondem02()
                        {
                                return <h1> iam functionbased component</h1>

                        }
                        export default demo2;


 3)react
 1) using React.createElement("tag.name","hello")
    eg:
    React.createElement("h1", "null", "hello")
     React.createElement("h2", "{id: "demo"}", "hello")



PROPS: stands for properties
     used to send dATA FRom one component to component.
     props are uni direction.
     props  are object.
     props are immutable( read-only)-means we cant rewrite the props.
     return  


     State: > state is used to store the data in the sAME component and update the
      data  in the sAME component
      > STATE are mutable(can be read&write)
      >state syntax: let[intial-value , function] =useState(intial-value)
